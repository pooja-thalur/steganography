## Roadmap

- Enabling encryption of data

## Steganography is not Cryptography ! :confused:

If you are getting confused between _Steganography_ & _Cryptography_. Then see this -

#### Steganography
Steganography is “the act of writing in code or cipher.” Deep steganography often refers to hiding a message in plain sight, typically in a digital image.

>Knowledge fact: Jeff Bezos's mobile was hacked by hiding malicious code in a media file which on getting downloaded sent the host device's control to the hacker.
>Fun fact: There's even rumor that Leonardo Da Vinci used steganography to embed a hidden message into the “Last Supper” art piece. During World War II, photosensitive glass was used to exchange hidden images and words between allied armies.
